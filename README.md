<h2>CP1291 (Advanced JavaScript) Course Project - JQuery Plugin - Hockey Stats</h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>
  - Download the files in the git repo https://github.com/hutch2323/CP1291-CourseProject-JQueryPlugin
  - Unzip the downloaded folder and add the following files to your existing website:
      - js/app.js
      - js/jquery-3.6.0-min.js
      - js/jquery.team-info.js
      - images/ (all images from the images folder)
  - Note: it is important that you add all JavaScript files listed above to a directory called js/ and keep all the images in the images/ directory.
  - If you would like to demo the plugin, you can simply launch the index.html file located in the downloaded zip file. This will make use of the css/style.css file
    and the js/script.js, which are simple files used for demonstration purposes.
  
Step 2:
  - Add the following script tags to your HTML file:
      <pre>
        <code>
          <script src="js/jquery-3.6.0-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	        <script src="js/script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
          <script src="js/jquery.team-info.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
          <script src="js/app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        </code>
      </pre>
